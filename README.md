Learning does not always need to be in a classroom, there are many valuable skills you need to become a videogame developer that you learn outside of the classroom. Some of these include video game projects, training, work experience, and job-shadowing. Having prior knowledge in videogame development is obviously good when trying to become a videogame developer, but failed projects are also helpful as long as you know what went wrong. For training there are many programing, leadership, and animation courses out there that will aid you when pursuing this career. Having previous employment experience is also helpful especially in the same industry which is why co-op is extremely valuble. If co-op is not an option, you could job-shadow a videogame developer and get important insight into how it is done.
